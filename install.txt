install MySQL, webserver(apache) and php

the port for MysQL (3306) and the webserver (80) https (443) have to be open

MySQL config my.ini  on windows in ProgramData\MySQL\MYSQL server
	sql-mode="NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"  - if strict mode the updating will stop on instead of throw a warning so problematic
	secure-file-priv = <upload folder>  - set the folder load data commands can use
	ft_stopword_file = ""  - the stopwords is not relevant for how I use fulltext search
	innodb_ft_min_token_size=1  - so you can search for 1 letter in fulltext search for stuff like collector and original text
	ft_min_word_len=1           - so you can search for 1 letter in fulltext search for stuff like collector and original text
create users for the web server (should only be reachable from localhost) and the coordinate tool with relevant 
 
Apache config  conf/httpd.conf
	# remove # to enable php as an module
	LoadModule php_module "c:/php/php8apache2_4.dll"  
	#custom error log format to include URl with query string in error log.
	ErrorLogFormat "[%t] [%l] [URL %{Request_URI}e] %M [referer\ %{Referer}i]"
	#enable SSL/https
	LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so  # remove #
	Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf  # remove #
SSL/TLS conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
	# Don't know how to configure... SSL certificates

php config - php.ini in the php install folder
	post_max_size = 900M 			- updating needs to upload big files
	file_uploads = On			- updating needs to upload big files
	upload_tmp_dir = <temp upload folder>	- temp folder for uploading files
	upload_max_filesize = 500M		- updating needs to upload big files
	extension=pdo_mysql			- php uses pdo drivers for MYSQL

On windows
	MYSQL and apache needs rights to read and write in the <upload folder> and <temp uplad folder> the rights get inherited from the temp foder not the final so MYSQL need rights on the tempfolder even if it should not touch the files there.
