                    <h3> Maps (through Google maps) </h3>
                    Maps showing the location of collection sites can be made from any specimen list (click on “Map”), but they will only include specimens provided with coordinates or, for Sweden, with “district” [i Sverige socken/församling]. Please be aware of that records with erroneous coordinates are also plotted. Records that don't appear on the maps can be listed by clicking the figure showing the actual number of unmapped records..  <br />
            
                    <h3> Precautions concerning reliability of data </h3>

                    <b> Determinations are not definitive. </b> Herbarium specimens are filed according to the most recent determinations, and these are by no means definitive. Parts of the material, e.g. certain families, genera [släkten] or species [arter], have been reviewed by specialists, but most of the specimens have never been checked critically, and new material may have been accessed after a certain taxon was under review. The entered determinations should thus not be regarded as completely trustworthy, and we strongly advise that the actual specimens should be checked before records based on our material is included in a publication. To secure this, all serious workers are welcome as visitors. Loans of specimens (limited numbers) can also be arranged to botanical institutions worldwide. <br />
                    <b> There will always be errors. </b> Errors occur, e.g. due to difficulties with the interpretation of labels, or to mistakes made by us during the entering process. We like feedback, and will be happy to receive reports on errors, and suggestions of improvements. Please notify us at <script type="text/javascript">
