install MySQL, webserver(apache) and php

the port for MysQL (3306) and the webserver have to be open

MySQL config my.ini  on windows in ProgramData\MySQL\MYSQL server
	sql-mode="NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"  - if strict mode the updating will stop on instead of throw a warning so problematic
	secure-file-priv = <upload folder>  - set the folder load data commands can use
	ft_stopword_file = ""  - the stopwords is not relevant for how I use fulltext search
create users for the web server (should only be reachable from localhost) and the coordinate tool with relevant 
 
Apache config
	- enable php as an module

php config - php.ini in the php install folder
	post_max_size = 900M 			- updating needs to upload big files
	file_uploads = On			- updating needs to upload big files
	upload_tmp_dir = <temp upload folder>	- temp folder for uploading files
	upload_max_filesize = 500M		- updating needs to upload big files
	extension=pdo_mysql			- php uses pdo drivers for MYSQL

On windows
	MYSQL and apache needs rights to read and write in the <upload folder> and <temp uplad folder> the rights get inherited from the temp foder not the final so MYSQL need rights on the tempfolder even if it should not touch the files there.
